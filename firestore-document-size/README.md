# Firestore Document Size

**Author**: Alex Mamo (**[github.com/alexmamo](https://github.com/alexmamo)**)

**Description**: Calculates the size of a Firestore document whenever a new document is created or updated in a specific collection.

**Details**: Use this extension to calculate the size of a document in a Firestore collection of your choice so you can always stay below the maximum 1,048,576 bytes limitation.

Why write the size of the documents in the Realtime Database? It's because:
* The write operation is free of charge.
* The read operation is very cheap, as we only read a number that can have a maximum of 9 digits.

Additionally, this extension can be set to backfill existing documents in a specified collection to calculate the size of all documents.
